# Kaishi 1.5k

##### What is this?
This is a fork of the Kaishi 1.5k deck, but with pictures included.

##### Status
All the cards in the deck currently have images. While I am quite confident about how well the images fit, I am a total beginner in Japanese, so I do not know if the matches are 100% accurate. I have used resources such as Jisho to best try to determine the meanings and uses of words.
